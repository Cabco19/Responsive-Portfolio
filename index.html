            <p>I'm a native New Yorker and have been living in Chapel Hill since 2002, when I moved here with my family from Vermont. We have a recent college graduate, a child in college and an eighth grader still at home. I have some training in web development (html, CSS, and WordPress) and have worked in the field at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and as a part-time freelancer for The Rome Foundation, an organization for gastrointestinal research. My work has largely been front-end development, with some projects incorporating data input systems and other features. I have a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from St. Michael's College in Vermont and with my interest in computer programming, I'm merging the two disciplines.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, hiking, traveling and spending time with my family.</p>
